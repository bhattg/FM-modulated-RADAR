# FM-modulated-RADAR
This repository was the part of the course project in the course ELL-311 - Communication Engineering. <br/>
## Problem Statement :
The problem statement is as follows:- <br/>
1) Propose a mechanism that can be installed in a radar system to detect objects. Discuss about its robustness. <br/>
2) Now extend this analysis to multiple object detections. <br/>
3) Finally according to the channel model, suggest what is the effect of noise in your technique.

## Results :
The report and the detailed analysis can be found  [here](./Report.pdf) .
